## 📂 Repository Contents

### 🔹 Encoding.ipynb

Implementation of:

* Creating custom datasets
* Label Encoding
* One-Hot Encoding
* Ordinal Encoding

### 🔹 Feature Scaling Implementation

Performed scaling techniques on numerical data:

* **Normalization (MinMax/Normalizer)** → scales values between 0 and 1
* **Standardization (StandardScaler)** → mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

Demonstrates how scaling improves model performance and ensures uniform feature contribution.
